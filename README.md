# Network Home Lab

This repository documents my hands-on networking and cloud security labs.

The purpose of this project is to build real-world infrastructure skills by designing, deploying, testing, and documenting network environments.

Each lab is structured like a mini engineering project, including:

- Architecture diagram
- Implementation steps
- Verification tests
- Troubleshooting
- Key technical concepts

## Lab Structure

### Lab 1 – Azure Virtual Network & NSG Traffic Control

Built an Azure virtual network and deployed Windows and Ubuntu virtual machines in the same subnet.  
Validated internal Layer 3 connectivity using ICMP, configured static private IP addressing, and enforced traffic control using Network Security Group (NSG) rules.
